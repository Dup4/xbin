# xbin

Your serverless toolkit.

## Install

Copy and paste the content from [`xbin.zsh`](./xbin.zsh)(Or
[`xbin.sh`](./xbin.sh) if you use Bash) to you current shell.

(This will work only for the current shell, if you want `xbin` always work under
your shell, you need to put the function (the content of the `xbin.zsh`) into
your `~/.zshrc`, so that `xbin` will be always available for you)

## Usage

Just put `xbin` before the command that you want to run.

Like this:
